# Puget Sound Water Quality

This was a Code Jam **Competition** project that I worked on after the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a light-hearted team project designed to showcase my Tableau and Collaboration skills.  
The purpose was to create a visually compelling story from a provided dataset **in 4 days with Tableau and collaboration**.

This project highlights my strengths in:  
Data Analysis & Exploration (understanding and manipulating data)  
Data Visualization (creating clear and informative visuals)  
Tableau Calculations, Parameters, and Sets  
Communication & Teamwork (conveying insights and collaborating effectively)  

**YouTube LIVE recording of the entire competition with host Q&A can be found** can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/live/DWhX2HIf83Q)

### Description:
- 1 Tableau Story made from 4 Dashboards and 11 visuals
- Includes parameters, calculations, sets, and a final presentation of the Tableau Story.  
**The Tableau Public page** can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/views/PugetSound-WaterQuality/Presentation?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  

### Process:
1) Held a *Discord* Call to organize our team details and technical details on how to best seamlessly share the work between time zones and workstations.  
2) Each team member explored, filtered, and cleaned the data for EDA.  
3) Utilized *Google Docs* to create "LIVE Notes" to create a decomposition. While keeping in constant connection via *Discord*, our research collaboration led to the hypothesis and story plan.
4) We each created visualizations for our parts, and I combined those parts into a single Workbook.
5) Presented our assigned portions of the presentation on a *LIVE YouTube* presentation.  

### Data
The data was one .csv file provided by TripleTen, originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/water-quality) and one .csv file joined from the Kings County Website:
- `'water-quality-1.csv'`: This dataset contains water quality samples collected from Puget Sound, lakes, and streams in the region. Crossed-out fields were not included in the analysis due to time constraints.
    - `'Sample ID'`: Unique identifier for each sample taken.
    - ~`'Grab ID'`: Identifier for the specific grab instance associated with the sample.~
    - ~`'Profile ID'`: Identifier for the profile associated with the sample.~
    - ~`'Sample Number'`: Sequential number assigned to each sample.~
    - `'Collect DateTime'`: Date and time when the sample was collected.
    - `'Depth (m)'`: Depth at which the sample was collected, measured in meters.
    - `'Site Type'`: The type of site where the sample was collected (e.g., river, lake, well).
    - `'Area'`: Geographic area or region where the sample was collected.
    - ~`'Locator'`: Locator information indicating the precise location of the sample.~
    - ~`'Site'`: Specific site or location where the sample was collected.~
    - `'Parameter'`: The parameter measured or analyzed in the sample (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen).
    - `'Value'`: Value of the parameter measured in the sample.
    - `'Units'`: Units of measurement for the parameter value.
    - ~`'QualityId'`: Identifier indicating the quality of the data.~
    - ~`'Lab Qualifier'`: A Qualifier assigned by the laboratory indicating any special conditions or characteristics of the sample.~
    - ~`'MDL (Method Detection Limit)'`: Method detection limit for the parameter.~
    - ~`'RDL (Reporting Detection Limit)'`: Reporting detection limit for the parameter.~
    - ~`'Text Value'`: Textual representation of the parameter value.~
    - ~`'Sample Info'`: Additional information related to the sample.~
    - ~`'Steward Note'`: Notes or comments provided by the data steward.~
    - ~`'Replicates'`: Number of replicates taken for the sample.~
    - ~`'Replicate Of'`: An identifier indicating the sample of which this is a replicate.~
    - ~`'Method'`: Method used for analysis or measurement.~
    - `'Date Analyzed'`: The date when the sample was analyzed.
    - ~`'Data Source'`: Source of the data.~
- `'WLRD_Sites_20240906.csv'`: Additional table to provide GPS coordinates for collection areas.

### Assumptions:
1) Rows with vital fields shown as NULL were excluded.
2) Different Units can be shown on one visual if the values are not directly compared.
3) Similar parameters(field) can be grouped.

### Findings:
- Marine Offshores had the highest Densities and Light measurements.
- Large Lakes had the highest Chlorophyll, hardness, and oxygen levels.
- Streams and Rivers had the highest bacteria levels.
- Marine Intertidal zones and Swimming Beaches had their highest levels of bacteria, not as high as streams and rivers.
- Chlorophyll spiked in 2007 but returned to baseline in 2012, suggesting a trend of increase over time.
- Light measurements started spiking and returning to baseline in 2002 several times, suggesting a trend of increase over time.
- **Bacteria had higher levels in the 70s and 80s, suggesting a trend of decrease over time.**
- Time of day plays a role in measurement values, especially with light measurements. *It is recommended to take samples at the same time every day for future samples.*
- Sample integrity is negatively affected by the difference in time of collection and time of analysis, *it is recommended to analyze samples immediately*.
- Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, and Salinity samples were most often collected at farther depths than other samples.
- Depth of collection has a positive correlation with Salinity and Nitrogen while having a negative correlation with Light, Oxygen, and Bacteria.
- **The waters around Puget Sound are not Drinkable**.
- Most Bacteria levels decrease throughout the day; the lowest point is when the sun is highest.

### Results:
**Collaborative Brainstorming**: I effectively worked with a team to identify interesting stories within the provided datasets.  
**Data-Driven Storytelling**: I focused on insights supported by data, ensuring clear and ethical use of information.  
**Visual Storytelling**: I created unique data visualizations that complemented the narrative and communicated key points effectively.  
**Presentation Skills**: I participated in crafting a clear and concise presentation that showcased our project's findings within a limited timeframe.  

### Notes:
Our 3rd member dropped out of the competition after the 2nd day due to work time constraints.
