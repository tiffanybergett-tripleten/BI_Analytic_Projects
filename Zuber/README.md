# The Zuber Database

This was the second project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program.  
It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned in SQL.  
The purpose was to find patterns in the available information from competitors to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

### Description:
- 6-Step SQL query.
- Exploratory data analysis and investigation of whether the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays.

### Process:
1) Analyzed taxi rides by the company for specific dates, sorting by trip count.
2) Analyzed rides for companies containing specific keywords, grouping by company name.
3) Retrieved neighborhood IDs for O'Hare and Loop.
4) Categorize weather conditions by hour.
5) Retrieved Saturday rides from Loop to O'Hare, including weather and duration.
6) Sorted the results.

### Data
A database with info on taxi rides in Chicago provided by TripleTen:
- `'neighborhoods'` table: data on city neighborhoods
    - `'name'`: name of the neighborhood
    - `'neighborhood_id'`: neighborhood code
- `'cabs'` table: data on taxis
    - `'cab_id'`: vehicle code
    - `'vehicle_id'`: the vehicle's technical ID
    - `'company_name'`: the company that owns the vehicle
- `'trips'` table: data on rides
    - `'trip_id'`: ride code
    - `'cab_id'`: code of the vehicle operating the ride
    - `'start_ts'`: date and time of the beginning of the ride (time rounded to the hour)
    - `'end_ts'`: date and time of the end of the ride (time rounded to the hour)
    - `'duration_seconds'`: ride duration in seconds
    - `'distance_miles'`: ride distance in miles
    - `'pickup_location_id'`: pickup neighborhood code
    - `'dropoff_location_id'`: dropoff neighborhood code
- `'weather_records'` table: data on weather
    - `'record_id'`: weather record code
    - `'ts'`: record date and time (time rounded to the hour)
    - `'temperature'`: temperature when the record was taken
    - `'description'`: a brief description of weather conditions, e.g., "light rain" or "scattered clouds"

### Assumptions:
1) There isn't a direct connection between the `'trips'` table and `'weather_records'` table in the database.
2) `'neighborhood_id'` is the Primary Key for the `'neighborhoods table'`.
3) `'cab_id'` is the Primary Key for the `'cabs table'`.
4) `'trip_id'` is the Primary Key for the `'trips table'`.
5) `'record_id'` is the Primary Key for the `'weather_records table'`.

### Findings:
- The taxi company "Flash Cab" had the highest number of taxi rides for Nov. 15th-16th, 2017, at 19,558 trips.
- When searching SQL for a taxi company that contains the keyword "Yellow" or "Blue": The taxi company "Blue Diamond" had the highest number of taxi rides for Nov. 1st-7th, 2017, at 6,764 trips.
- When comparing the two most popular taxi companies, "Flash Cab" and "Taxi Affiliation Services", with all other available companies for Nov. 1st - 7th, 2017, the total number of taxi rides from "Other" is significantly higher than each top company, separate or combined.
- The SQL "neighborhood_id" identifiers of the O'Hare and Loop neighborhoods are ID # 63 and 50, respectively.
- Each hour had been given a designated weather condition, starting with a Good designation.
- A SQL table was printed to show all rides that started in the Loop on a Saturday and ended at O'Hare. Tables included Start time, weather conditions, and duration.
