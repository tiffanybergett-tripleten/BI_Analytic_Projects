# E-Commerce_Business_Analysis

This was the third project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned in Business Analytics. The purpose was to analyze the companies' raw transaction logs and turn the event logs into business metrics.

### Description:
- 8-page spreadsheet
- Includes raw data (Hidden), processed data, data analysis, and pivot tables.
**Google Speadsheet** can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vkoLxZqsaqfEHdvRRf5ifXiv42zfPA01v6DPhiN9O_k/edit?usp=sharing)

### Process:
1) Explored, filtered, and cleaned the data.
2) Created and built a conversion funnel.
3) Transformed data for cohort analysis.
4) Calculated retention rates.
5) Finalized the formatting and documentation for the client's readability.

### Data
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen. Raw Data Google Spreadsheet can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qWRY5svKGkJRyYNv7K4XvEGm9FpcoJhH5G0p4Qbq0V0/edit?usp=sharing)
- `'Business Analyst Project.csv'`: raw transaction logs
    - `'raw_user_activity'`: Each row represents an activity, or event, by a user on the companyâ€™s website
        - `'user_id'`: unique customer IDs
        - `'event_type'`: the type of activity by the user
        - `'category_code'`: category of the product being viewed or purchased
        - `'brand'`: the company that makes the product
        - `'price'`: price of the product, in USD
        - `'event_date'`: date of the user activity, in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - `'Table of Contents'`: Pre-formatted yet empty table of contents sheet
    - `'Executive Summary`: Pre-formatted yet empty executive summary sheet

### Assumptions:
1) The "raw_user_activity" sheet accurately reflects all website activity for the relevant timeframe.
2) Missing values or inconsistencies in the data are minimal and can be ignored.
3) The provided data format (columns, data types) is correct and consistent.

### Findings:
| Results | Synopsis |
| :-----------: | ----------- |
| Conversion Funnel | The total conversion rate from view to purchase was 10%. While the view-to-shopping cart conversion rate was 29% | 
| Retention Rates | Retention rates for the 2020-09 cohort group after the first month were only 13%; by the 4th month, it was down to 3%. | 

### Recommendations:
- Address Shopping Cart Abandonment and Purchase Conversion. Future projects can focus on the best approach, such as product page vs checkout process, as a source of funnel deterioration.
- Enhance customer engagement and loyalty. Potential marketing campaigns could be personalized communications, loyalty programs, and looking into customer support.
- Gain customer feedback for a more targeted strategy.
- Continue data-driven insights to follow changes in the cohort analysis.
