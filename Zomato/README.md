# Zomato Customer Analysis

This was my Final project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program.  
It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned throughout the TripleTen Program.  
The purpose was to complete the Zomato onboarding project to showcase analytical skills to the mock company.

### Description:
- This was a Customer Segmentation Analysis.  
- 2 pages in Power BI.  
- Includes KPI cards, Pie charts, bar charts, and RFM analysis.  

### Process:
1) Requirements gathering and familiarizing myself with the data.
2) Created a Decomposition Plan for the team lead for approval.  
3) Cleaned the data and joined the necessary tables.
4) Analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards.  
5) Presented my findings in a written Google Doc report.  

### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 2 for this project.  
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed Excel files provided by the team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th, 2017, and June 26th, 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
- `'Measures Table'`: Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of the original files. Housing all used measures.
- `'Calendar'`: Created a table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of the original files. Housing all the data information for potential calculations.
- `'Segmentations'`: Created a table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of the original files. Housing all segments and RFM scores needed for inclusion.
- `'RFM Table'`: Created table for analysis and to maintain the integrity of original files. Housing all RFM calculations.

### Assumptions:
1) The provided test datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
2) Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
3) The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
4) The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
5) Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

### Findings:
- Customers mostly consist of 23-year-old unmarried men.
- There is a natural distribution for age; however, the range is small at 18-34.
- Women are close behind, but there are significantly more customers who are single than married.
- Zomatoâ€™s customers usually have small family sizes (2-3) and are educated but unemployed.
- Employed customers tend to be below middle class ($50,000/yr).
