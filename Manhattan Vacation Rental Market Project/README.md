# Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Project

This is VERSION 2 of the first project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned about Advanced Spreadsheets. This project is about analyzing Airbnb listings in Manhattan, NYC, to help a client decide what type of vacation rental property to invest in.

### Description:
- 17 page spreadsheet
- Includes organizational tabs, raw data (Hidden), processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, and bar charts.
**Projects Google Speadsheet** can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dNFTH1PFCCO9aLPLjjbvPxlqKe1Hkd2Nenf2dFyWxe0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Process:
1) **Data Preparation**: *Filtering* techniques were used to identify and clean inconsistencies within the Airbnb data. Irrelevant columns were hidden to maintain a focused analysis. Key functions such as PROPER, TRIM, IF, ISNUMBER, FIND, ROUND, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, CHOOSE, and WEEKDAY were employed for data tidying.
2) **Neighborhood Analysis**: Identify the top-performing neighborhoods based on review frequency via *Pivot Table*.
3) **Property Size Analysis**: Determine the optimal property sizes for each neighborhoodvia *Pivot Table* showcased with *conditional formatting*.
4) **Revenue Analysis**: Calculate estimated annual revenue for the most attractive listings.
5) **Additional Optional Analysis**: Perform Analysis through *Pivot Tables* for occupancy rates by day, price by super host status, check-in ratings by use of doormen, and price by review ratings.
6) **Data Visualization**: Create clear and informative *visualizations* (charts) to present findings.
7) **Formatting and Organization**: Ensure your analysis is well-formatted for ease of readability.
8) **Documentation**: Create organizational sheets like an executive summary, table of contents, assumptions log, and change log.
 
### Data
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen, A Copy can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7KNEYs_YtQP57mWXRddPGAI3Sk-tPzLnCsdysCSw_c/edit?usp=sharing):
- `'nyc_airbnb_data.csv'`: Each row corresponds to one listing on Airbnb in September 2022
    - `'data_dictionary'`: summary of field titles seen in the file and their data type
    - `'listings'`: unique listings available with all available data
    - `'calendar'`: listings with upcoming availabilities and date-type data

### Assumptions:
1) Airbnb rentals are equivalent to the general short-term vacation rental market.
2) Only properties with a Minimum night requirement of 7 days or less were considered. 
3) Properties with no reviews in the last 12 months were considered inactive.
4) Reviews reflect rental frequency; we used "number_of_reviews_ltm" to measure a listing's attractiveness.
5) Super luxury listings with prices greater than $1,321.21 were filtered from the analysis, 1% outlier.
6) Extremely low-priced listings of less than $85.28 were filtered from the analysis, 1% outlier.
7) Estimated Annual Revenue can be calculated by comparing averages for top listings.
8) "Building staff" equates to a Doorman.
9) A listing of 9k can be excluded when examining price/review due to it being an extreme outlier.

### Findings and Recommendations:
- The top recommended neighborhoods for vacation rentals are as follows: Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, Upper East Side.	
- The top rental size is 1 bedroom overall. Lower East Side properties should have 1-bedroom units to meet demand. Hell's Kitchen prefers 2 bedrooms and Midtown prefers Studio.	
- The estimated annual revenue based on top listing characteristics is $69,957.	
- Fridays have the highest occupancy rate out of the week; average occupancy is 86.4%.	
- Instant bookings do have higher occupancy rates, statistically significant, the average is 52%.	
- Superhosts can charge higher prices, which are statistically significant, on average $334.	
- Building with doormen gets better reviews, statistically significant, by 0.05 stars.	
- Hosts can charge higher prices for higher review ratings.
