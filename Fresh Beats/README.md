# Fresh Beats Status Report

This was an optional project I worked on after the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a junior-level project to turn an analysis into a report presentation.

Fresh Beats is a music streaming platform catering to listeners and up-and-coming musicians. It offers music streaming and helps new artists gain exposure through promotional services.
The platform faces challenges in optimizing these areas:

- Ensuring artist promotions are effective and deliver value for musicians.
- Converting free listeners into paying subscribers.
- Recommending music effectively, especially for highlighting new artists in relevant genres.

A Google Doc with a template for the project was provided. Blank Sections included:
- `'Summary'`

### Assumptions:
1) Data Availability: The project assumes that all the necessary data for analyzing user engagement and business challenges is available in the provided dataset spreadsheet.
2) Data Accuracy: The project assumes that the data in the spreadsheet is accurate and reflects the user behavior on the Fresh Beats platform.
3) Insights and Visualizations Quality: The project assumes that the provided insights and visualizations are reliable and accurately represent the data within the spreadsheet.
4) Report Template Suitability: The project assumes that the provided report template is appropriate for presenting the findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

### Findings:

User Engagement and Conversion:
- Paid users are more engaged: They listen to more music and show better retention. Converting free users to paid subscribers is a key strategy.
- Genre preferences differ: Rock is popular with free users, while Indie is popular with paid users. Tailoring recommendations based on user type can improve engagement.
- Artist Promotion Effectiveness and Genre Promotion for Emerging Artists:
- Pop music is declining: Electronic and Hip-Hop are gaining traction. Fresh Beats should consider these trends when curating music and promoting artists.

### Recommendations:
- Target new music trends: Run targeted marketing campaigns and expand the music library for Electronic and Hip-Hop.
- Maximize User Engagement:
    - Paid User Conversion: Offer promotions and tiered subscriptions to convert free users.
    - Free User Engagement: Analyze Rock listener retention and experiment with Rock-focused promotions.
- Research and Analyze:
    - Pop Decline: Investigate the reasons behind the decline in Pop music popularity.
    - Rock User Conversion: Analyze factors affecting Rock listener retention and explore ways to convert them to paid users.
- Focus on Paid Users: Promote Indie music, which is popular with paid users.
