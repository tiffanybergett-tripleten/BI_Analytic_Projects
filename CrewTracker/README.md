CrewTracker Software Migration

This was my externship project, which I worked on after graduating from the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a team project designed to help a real-world company, CrewTracker Software, modernize its reporting system by migrating over 170 Crystal Reports to interactive Power BI dashboards, improving data visualization and user experience for CrewTracker's clients.

### Description:
- 172 Crystal Reports requested for conversion.
    - All Crystal reports were cataloged for future Externships/Crewtrackers Analyst Team.
    - 18 Power BI Reports completed, including Merge Reports.
- First Responder (5 members): Extract data from Crystal Reports.
- Peer Reviewer - Review and validate Power BI reports.
- Power BI Team - Convert & consolidate reports and design interactive dashboards with longevity.

### Process:
- First Responder:
	1) Connect to CrewTracker Workstation via Remote Desktop Connection.
	2) Screenshot/grab the Crystal Report Expected Layout.
	3) Screenshot/grab Crystal Reports Field Explorer Details.
	4) Save the exported PDF view of Crystal Reports.
	5) Copy the SQL Query from Crystal Reports.
	6) Copy the formula field SQL parts and any linked Sub-Reports.
- Peer Reviewer:
     1Ô∏è) Make sure you can open the Power BI file and determine that it looks more or less like the original Crystal Report.  
     2Ô∏è) Check the SQL Query is there, and it looks like the original.  
     3Ô∏è) Check that all formula fields have been converted to calculated fields or measures in Power BI. 
     4Ô∏è) Check for completeness and whether the report is achieving the original purpose.  
-Call List Merge Report:  
     1) Merge the source SQL Queries into one SQL Direct Query.  
     2) Build a Power BI Dashboard according to the Call List Reports layout expectations. Using best judgment for variances between the three reports.  
     3) Convert Crystal Report Formula Fields into Power BI DAX as Measures and Calculations, ensuring the formatting allows for various potential future uses.  

### Data
CrewTracker Software's Microsoft SQL Database (CREWAI and its Dummy Database SnowTracker) on Azure Cloud (anonymized data).
-Large Database with 97 total tables with high-level relationships.

### Assumptions:
1) Reports on the initial list that could not be found on the workstation were no longer needed and listed as "File Not Found."
2) If a Crystal Report could not open, it needed to be rerouted to a dummy server for this Externship.
3) Each Crystal report needed a 1-1 conversation into a Powwer BI Dashboard. However, as our experience in the conversation process grew, this requirement was adjusted for comfort level, and we were allowed to create merged reports based on a similarity map.

### Results:
Through my *externship, CrewTracker* was able to move from *Crystal Reports (a legacy reporting tool that can be cumbersome for complex data analysis. We were able to initiate efforts to convert all report data to Power BI. This modern platform allows for more user-friendly and interactive dashboards, facilitating deeper data insights. By providing a more intuitive reporting system, CrewTracker will empower its clients to gain a clearer understanding of their data, ultimately leading to improved decision-making and potentially higher client satisfaction.

### Personal Stats:
- As a First Responder, I attempted to Catalog = 91 Crystal Reports
- Successful Cataloged Crystal Reports = 73 (the remaining files were "File Not Found")
- Power BI conversations Peer Reviewed = 9
- Power BI Report Completed = 3 (Merged Report into 1)
